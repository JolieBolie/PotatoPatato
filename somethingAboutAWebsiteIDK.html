    <h1> The Umbrella Academy </h1>
    <p>
    <pre>
The Umbrella Academy is a group of super hero children. It started as a comic, made by Gerard Way, former known as the lead singer of the popular band
My Chemical Romance. The comic mainly forcused on their lives as children, but the newest Netflic adaptation takes a spin on craeting their stories as
mentally messed up adults, terribly affected by how they were raised as children.

The story in both the comic and show starts the same; with 43 babies being spontaneously
born on the same day, their mothers no where near pregnant beforehand. Sir Reginald
Hargreeves, adopts seven, creating the Umbrella Academy. He was best known for being a
cold, strict, and distant father by his children; which is evident by the fact that he
only ever called the children by their assigned numbers.
